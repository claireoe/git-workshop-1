There once was a girl called claire

At her screen all she did was stare

Because this git makes no sense

And it makes us really tense


There once was a girl called katie lee

However she was unable to see

How to access the work

It sent her berserk 

So claire completed it for her

the end xox


There once was a girl called claire

At her screen all she did was stare

Because this git makes no sense

And it makes us really tense

There once was a guy name julian lewins

This day sending him to ruins

He wished it was easier

And that outside was less breezier

So he can bask in the sun
